# Abstract:
This project primarily focuses on routing optimization in networks by implementing 
advanced graph algorithms in Python, particularly using the NetworkX library for efficient 
computational handling and visualization. The project mainly explores four algorithms: 
Dijkstraâ€™s, Bellman-Ford, Genetic optimizer for multiple attribute route optimization, and 
the nearest neighbor heuristic optimized to solve the traveling salesman problem. The 
common parameters associated with nodes for calculating optimal path are position, 
bandwidth, mobility, transmission power, packet loss, and battery capacity that will 
influence the optimal path choice and its efficiency. The project analyzes algorithms, its 
strengths and limitations under dynamic conditions. This sets a foundation for adaptive 
robust routing strategies that can later be developed around these algorithms. It provides 
knowledge about how specific node attributes could be exploited to improve routing 
efficiency and reliability in modern communication networks. It contributes significantly 
towards optimizing network practice.
